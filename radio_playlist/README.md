Last week one of the local radio stations was having a "Barrel of Monkey" afternoon. While a song was playing, listeners would call in and suggest the next song, which had to begin with the same letter as the current song ended in.

So, for example, a sample (eclectic) Barrel of Monkeys playlist might be:

Peace Train 

No More "I Love You's" 

Super Trooper 

Rock Me, Amadeus 

Song of the South

Hooked on a Feeling

Go Tell it on the Mountain
...
(See how each song name begins with the last letter of the song before it?)

Just creating ANY playlist would be too easy, however. We need a Worthy Problem to solve.

1) Given any starting and ending song, create a playlist that connects the
   two songs.

2) For extra credit, try to create a playlist of a specific duration (to
   fill a particular time slot on the radio).

3) For more extra credit, try to find the shortest playlist that links the
   songs. (Either in terms of number of songs, or total play time.)

You can find an XML file with over 5,000 song names and play time at SongLibrary.xml. The song durations are in milliseconds.
