### Problem Description

The objective of Sudoku puzzles is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

A well constructed Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle.

#### Objectives

This kata has several goals:

1. Solve a problem for which TDD is not particularly useful.
2. Allow flexibility is data structures by providing puzzles as text files.
3. Promote diversity in implementations and encourage unique techniques.
4. Encourage use of different languages and language features.
5. Work in small teams!

Most importantly, think creatively. A half-complete attempt that uses interesting technique is more interesting for this exercise. Does your solution perform differently for puzzles of varied logical difficulty? What trade-offs did you consider in your design?

The puzzles I have selected are not especially difficult. If you finish an interesting implementation with time to spare, I have harder puzzles to give your program.

I will ask two people to talk for 5-10 minutes about their solution -- have fun! :100:
